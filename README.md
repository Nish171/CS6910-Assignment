# Backpropagation and Optimization algorithms
 
The aim of this project is to implement a backpropagation framework from scratch using only numpy and pandas.
Using this backpropagation framework, various optimization algorithms where written. 

The optimaztion algorithms where used to train a neutral network on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
The performance on training data by the neural networks with different hyperparameters where recorded and visualizd using WandB's sweep function
and the best performing model was choosen based on validation accuracy.
